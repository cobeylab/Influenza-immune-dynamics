The worfklow of this directory is as follows:

1. Perform the model inference (using the code in the `Inference` subdirectory). Specifically, estimate the rate of waning of heterosubtypic protection by constructing a likelihood profile.

2. Analyze the inference results and calculate the parameter MLEs/95% CIs (using the code in the `Results_analysis` subdirectory).
